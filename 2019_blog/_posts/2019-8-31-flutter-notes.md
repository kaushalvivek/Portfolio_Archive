Flutter is a cross-platform application development framework built by Google and is relatively new. Noticeably though, it has considerable advantages over React Native, and in my personal opinion, it will be in high demand over the next few years. I was looking to learn a mobile development framework, and having taken a look at Fluter, I've decided to go ahead and learn it.

I will be posting notes, assignments and code-samples in the following repository:

If you have any requests, suggestions or queries, feel free to raise an issue in the above repository itself.
