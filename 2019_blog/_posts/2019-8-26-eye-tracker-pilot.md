I conducted this experiment as a part of an independent study under Dr.Prithwiraj Mukherjee form IIM-Bangalore and Dr.Kavita Vemuri from IIIT Hyderabad. The primary aim was to get myself used to the processes involved in an eye-tracker experimentation setup. Uploading this here for someone who is looking for a source of information on eye-tracker studies and does not have a background in the domain.

Useful criticism of the following approach:

- It is important to conduct a pre-test with the eye-tracker as a baseline cannot be assumed for a section of the population without any prior study on them.
