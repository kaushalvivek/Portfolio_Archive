Kauta is a programming language designed by a teammate and me for our Compilers coursework at IIIT Hyderabad under Dr. Suresh Purini. The language supports the following features:

### Data Types

- Signed and unsigned int 
- Double
- Bool
- Char 
- String
- 1D and 2D arrays

### Operators

- **Arithmetic Operations Supported**: add, sub, mul, div
- **Boolean Operations Supported**: and, or, not
- **Control Statements**: if-then, if-then-else, for loop, while loop, ternary operator
- **Functions**: Call by value supported, recursion supported

Kauta supports basic I/O routines that are limited to single value scanning and multiple variable printing in a single routine call.

The language's Context Free Grammar (CFG) and semantics woill be added after course culmination along with detailed guide for usage, documentation and self-coded compiler. The delay is to abide by course guidelines.
